work. Some software is directly bundled for convenience, other tools
are installed at build time or can be added at run time.

I'm trying to give credit where credit is due and to adhere to the
terms of the different licenses. I Am Not A Layer though, so please
get in touch if you feel something is amiss license-wise.
